<h3>What is Browser Compatibility?</h3>
<p>Browser compatibilty is the ways in which the same website may not always look the same in different browsers. Different browsers will read a websites code differently, so certain websites may not look exactly alike in different browsers. For example, the way a website looks in Internet Explorer may not be the same as it does in Google Chrome or Firefox. The question is how does one make their webisite appear the same and function efficiently on all browsers.</p>

<h3>What is Responsive Design?</h3>
<p> Responsive is design is similar to browser compatibility. Today we use a plethora of devices to browse the internet such as phones, tablets, and computers. Responsive design is about what makes a certain website look good and run efficiently on all these different types of devices.</p>

<h3> Why is Browser Compatibility important?</h3>
<p>Browser compatibility is important because there are many browsers to choose from and not everyone is using the same one. As a web designer you want your website to be compatibile with multiple browsers so when people visit your website they are able to use it effectively and efficiently no matter what browser they are using.</p>
